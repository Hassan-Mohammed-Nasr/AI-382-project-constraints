# AI-382-project-constraints
1- To use the provided constraints, download the desired constraint file in the same directory where your project code exist

2- Develop your program to read the constrains from the file to use them in the project

# There are two types of files
1- constraint files

2- optimal solution named optiml for {filename} (for correcting yourself not for copying it)

# Example of the constraint file 
'given_problem.txt' is the same problem given in the project guidline to solve it by hand

when you open the file you will see:

Number of ports and hotels respectively: 2,2             ------> this indicate the number of ports is 2 and number of hotels is 2

Supply of ports: 60,40                                   ------> this indicate that total number of pligirims arriving at port 1 is 60 and total for port 2 is 40

demand of hotels: 80,40                                 ------> this indicate that hotel 1 can accept no more than 80 and hotel 2 no more than 40

Cost from port 1 and 2 to Hotel 1 respectively: 100,80      ------> this indicate that the cost of going from port 1 to hotel 1 is 100 and from port 2 to hotel 1 is 80

Cost from port 1 and 2 to hotel 2 respectively: 90,120      -------> this indicate that the cost of going from port 1 to hotel 2 is 90 and from port 2 to hotel 2 is 120
